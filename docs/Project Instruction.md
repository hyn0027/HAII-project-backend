# Option B

Create something cool! Build an ML application to address a real-world problem.

## Scope

Keep in mind that the end of the semester gets busy, so although you will have a long time for this project, scope something that can be implemented in 2-ish weeks (you should consider the time spent beyond implementation, e.g., user research, prototypes, and pilot user evaluation). Better to have a polished demo that does one interesting thing with AI really well than try to do a ton of things and end up not getting any of them to work well. Make sure your project is a solid core task that you can achieve (see “minimum goal” above) as well as some ideas you’d like to implement with time but maybe more risky (“reach goals” above). In other words, try to separate out must-haves from would be nice to have as you brainstorm your application.

## Final submission format

### Code

You are welcome to make a local app, a browser app, a phone app, or whatever you deem appropriate for the interaction. Regardless of the format, you will need to submit a zip file or a Github repo containing all of your code resources and other resources to make your project run.

### Video Walkthrough

The rationale here is: I can’t always get everyone’s code to replicate on my machine without bugs. To give your project the best possible opportunity for grading well in case I run into problems running it, you will also submit a demo video. The demo video can be a cheap screen capture with a voice over where you film basically what your interaction does and how the user interacts with it. Don’t bother with amazing high-end video quality unless this is something for your own benefit that you’d like to capture for your own professional photo. It just needs to be the quality that we can understand what’s going on and hear your commentary during the walkthrough. You can upload this to canvas per your choice as a .mp3 or upload it to Youtube and submit us the link.

In the video walkthrough, you should also describe verbally (1) how the things you learn from the class (e.g., principles of human AI Interaction, how to mitigate the negative impacts of the different types of errors on user experiences, explainability and interpretability, privacy, and fairness etc.) and (2) how piloting with a potential user influence your design choices. Note that you are required to invite a pilot user to test use your system. The pilot user does not necessarily have to be the target users of your application/system. A convenient sample (e.g., your friend, or your family member) is fine.

## Final Project

### Presentation 5 minutes [30 points in total]

- [10 points] Clearly communicate what application you built and why you chose to build it.
- [5 points] Clearly communicate the dataset you used and concisely describe the implementation of your app (e.g., What model did you train? Do you find any open-source initial code? How did you change the initial code? )
- [5 points] Clearly communicate how the concepts from lectures impact your design.
- [5 points] Clearly demonstrates how the pilot user used your application and the insights you learned from the pilot user study.
- [5 points] Clarity of presentation and communication style

## Evaluation of your submission (code and video walkthrough) [70 points in total]

- [35 points] Submit a zip file or a Github repo containing all of your code resources and other resources that make your application run. Please include a README file that specifies what open-source code you imported (if any), what changes you made, and what new code you implemented. (If you built your application based on any open-source initial code, we expect you make nontrivial changes to the code.) 
- [35 points] Video walkthrough (screen capture with a voice-over) that clearly demonstrates what your application does and how the user interacts with it. Explain at least one design decision that is influenced by the class. Explain the insights you learned from the pilot user study.
