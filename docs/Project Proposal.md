# OPTION B

- What are your ideas (even vague) for the kind of applications you will build? Please give a reach goal for the best possible outcome you can envision from this project if things go well. Please give a minimum goal for the minimum you will be able to turn in if things go terribly wrong with your plan. This will help us give you feedback on the scoping of your project.
  - At a high level, I’d like to build an LLM-powered reading helper. It will be a web app where users can upload an article, and the application will assist them in reading by identifying the article’s structure and adding comments, links, or external information.
    - Reach goal: The system will identify the hierarchical structure of the article and display it alongside the user as they scroll. It will highlight key words and sentences, and provide explanations or links to external resources for terminology or information that is not considered common knowledge. It may support multi-languages.
    - Minimum goal: The system will assist readers by adding comments to passages, similar to comments in Google Docs.
- What are your learning goals from doing this project? Preferably, you should be able to say what you’ll learn from doing each part of the project.  
  - I want to learn how to apply HAII guidelines to real AI systems and understand the practical challenges that arise in real-world applications.
- What is the platform for your app? E.g. a web/mobile app, or any other format
  - A web app.
- Where will the ‘human’ user fit into your application? How are you going to apply the things you learn from this class to your app?  
  - The direct end users are people who use this system to help them read passages. Other humans related to the application might include the authors of the articles, the providers of external resources, or editors/commenters. I plan to apply the methods learned in this class to identify potential ethical risks in these systems and to mitigate them.

## Feedback

This sounds very useful and functional. What is needed next is to think through more specifically who are the users and what are the specific tasks they need to accomplish. If this is too general-purpose, I don't see how it is different from existing general purpose models and if there is a need to make a separate reading helper.
